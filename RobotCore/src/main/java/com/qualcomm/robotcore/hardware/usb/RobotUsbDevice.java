   * device descriptor. Windows uses that information to derive various sets of information. For
   * example, the idVendor and idProduct fields specify vendor and product identifiers, respectively.
   * Windows uses those field values to construct a hardware ID for the device. To view the hardware
   * ID of a particular device, open Device Manager and view device properties. In the Details tab,
   * the Hardware Ids property value indicates the hardware ID ("USB\XXX") that is generated by Windows.
   * The bcdUSB field indicates the version of the USB specification to which the device conforms.
   * For example, 0x0200 indicates that the device is designed as per the USB 2.0 specification. The
   * bcdDevice value indicates the device-defined revision number. The USB driver stack uses bcdDevice,
   * along with idVendor and idProduct, to generate hardware and compatible IDs for the device. You
   * can view the those identifiers in Device Manager. The device descriptor also indicates the total
   * number of configurations that the device supports"
