/**
 * {@link LockingRunner} provides non-recursive exclusive-lock semantics across threads, with an
 * API that matches {@link FileBasedLock} as closely as possible. The "non-recursive" (aka non-reentrant)
 * part is important to note, as it is a significant difference from how JVM locking usually works.
 * This class uses non-reentrant locking so that if {@link FileBasedLock} is ever fixed, it can be
 * used in place of this class with reduced worry of breakage.
 *
 * It's also important to note that while it's safe to create a new instance of {@link FileBasedLock}
 * every time you need one, the same is not true for {@link LockingRunner}.
